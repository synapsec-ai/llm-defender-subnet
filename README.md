# Bittensor LLM Defender Subnet (sn14)
This repository contains the source code for the LLM Defender subnet running on top of [Bittensor network](https://github.com/opentensor/bittensor). The LLM Defender subnet provides Large Language Model (LLM) developers a way to decentralize the computing required to detect and prevent various attacks and exploits against LLM applications. 

## Summary
There are different and constantly evolving ways to attack LLMs, and to efficiently protect against such attacks, it is necessary to layer up several defensive methods to prevent the attacks from affecting the LLM or the application relying on the model.

The subnet is being built with the concept of defense-in-depth in mind. The subnet aims to provide several **analyzers** each consisting of multiple **engines** to create a modular and high-performing capability for detecting attacks against LLMs.

The ultimate goal is to enable LLM developers to harness the decentralized intelligence provided by the subnet and combine it with their local defensive capabilities to truly embrace the concept of defense-in-depth.

The subnet is working such that the engines are providing a **confidence** score depicting how confident they are that a given input is an attack against an LLM. The summarized confidence score is used to reach a verdict on whether a given prompt is an attack against LLM or not. 

Due to the nature of the Bittensor network, the confidence score is a result of combined intelligence of hundreds of different endpoints providing LLM developers with unprecedented potential to secure their applications and solutions.

## Quickstart

This repository requires python3.10 or higher and Ubuntu 22.04/Debian 12. It is highly recommended to spin up a fresh Ubuntu 22.04 or Debian 12 machine for running the subnet neurons. Upgrading from python3.8 to python3.10 on Ubuntu 20.04 is known to cause issues with the installation of the python modules required by the miners.

> [!WARNING]  
> We are recommending to use python virtual environment (venv) when running either the validator or miner. Make sure the virtual environment is active prior to launching the pm2 instance.

Installation:
```
$ sudo apt update && sudo apt install jq && sudo apt install npm \
&& sudo npm install pm2 -g && pm2 update && sudo apt install git
$ git clone https://github.com/ceterum1/llm-defender-subnet
$ cd llm-defender-subnet
$ python -m venv .venv
$ source .venv/bin/activate
$ pip install bittensor
```

> [!NOTE]  
> During installation you might get an error "The virtual environment was not created successfully because ensurepip is not available". In this case, install the python3.11-venv (or python3.10-venv) package following the instructions on screen. After this, re-execute the `python3 -m venv .venv` command.

If you are not familiar with Bittensor, you should first perform the following activities:
- [Generate a new coldkey](https://docs.bittensor.com/getting-started/wallets#step-1-generate-a-coldkey)
- [Generate a new hotkey under your new coldkey](https://docs.bittensor.com/getting-started/wallets#step-2-generate-a-hotkey)
- [Register your new hotkey on our subnet 14](https://docs.bittensor.com/subnets/register-and-participate)

> [!NOTE]  
> Validators need to establish an internet connection with the miner. This requires ensuring that the port specified in --axon.port is reachable on the virtual machine via the internet. This involves either opening the port on the firewall or configuring port forwarding.

Run miner (if you run multiple miners, make sure the name and axon.port are unique):
```
$ cd llm-defender-subnet
$ source .venv/bin/activate
$ bash scripts/run_neuron.sh \
--name llm-defender-subnet-miner-0 \
--install_only 0 \
--max_memory_restart 10G \
--branch main \
--netuid 14 \
--profile miner \
--wallet.name YourColdkeyGoesHere \
--wallet.hotkey YourHotkeyGoesHere \
--axon.port 15000 \
```
You can optionally provide --miner_set_weights True|False, --subtensor.network, --subtensor.chain_endpoint, and --logging.debug arguments. If you provide the logging.* argument, make sure it is the last argument you provide.

Run validator (if you run multiple validators, make sure the name is unique):
```
$ cd llm-defender-subnet
$ source .venv/bin/activate
$ bash scripts/run_neuron.sh \
--name llm-defender-subnet-validator-0 \
--install_only 0 \
--max_memory_restart 5G \
--branch main \
--netuid 14 \
--profile validator \
--wallet.name YourColdkeyGoesHere \
--wallet.hotkey YourHotkeyGoesHere
```
You can optionally provide --subtensor.network, --subtensor.chain_endpoint and --logging.debug arguments. If you provide the logging.* argument, make sure it is the last argument you provide.

If you are running Miner and Validator with same hotkey, you need to set the `--miner_set_weights` to False. The parameter defaults to False.

Run auto-updater (only one instance needs to be running even if you have multiple PM2 instances active on the same machine):
```
$ cd llm-defender-subnet
$ source .venv/bin/activate
$ bash scripts/run_auto_updater.sh \
--update_interval 300 \
--branch main \
--pm2_instance_names llm-defender-subnet-validator-0 llm-defender-subnet-miner-0 \
--prepare_miners True
```

Replace the values for pm2_instance_names with the correct instance names from the earlier run commands. If you're running your miner/validator/auto-updater from branch other than main, you need to be in that particular branch when you create the PM2 instances. If you are only running a validator or you dont want to prepare the miners, set the `--prepare_miners` to False.

If you want to change the limit for the validator stake blacklist, you can adjust it with `--validator_min_stake` parameter (for example, `--validator_min_stake 0` to disable the minimum stake requirement)

The `run_neuron.sh` script creates \<instance_name>.config.js files containing the PM2 ecosystem configuration.

> [!WARNING]  
> The miner and validator resources will evolve as the subnet features evolve. GPU is not currently needed but may be needed in the future. Our recommendation is to start up with the resource defined in [min_compute.yml](./min_compute.yml) and monitor the resource utilization and scale the resource up or down depending on the actual utilization.

## Wandb
If you want to enable wandb support for either the validator or the miner, you need to perform additional steps as outlined below:
- Register for wandb and acquire license suitable for your user-case
- Create a new project and copy the API key for the project
- Copy the `.env.sample` to `.env` and fill in the parameters or setup environmental variables accordingly
```
$ cp .env.sample .env
```
Value for `WANDB_KEY` should be the project API key, value for `WANDB_PROJECT` should be the project name and `WANDB_ENTITY` should be your username. Additionally, `WANDB_ENABLE` must be set to `1` to enable wandb. Setting `WANDB_ENABLE` to `0` disables wandb even if other parameters are setup correctly.

Example of a valid `.env` file:
```
WANDB_ENABLE=1
WANDB_KEY=1234789abcdefghijklmopqrsu
WANDB_PROJECT=projectname
WANDB_ENTITY=username
```


## Troubleshooting 101
(1) How to run clean installation?
```
$ cd llm-defender-subnet
$ deactivate
$ rm -rf ~/.llm-defender-subnet
$ rm -rf ~/.cache/chroma
$ python3 -m venv .venv
$ source .venv/bin/activate
$ pip install -e .
```

(2) How to check from logs that my miner is working? If you see SUCCESS log entries in your miner log, your miner is working.
```
$ grep "SUCCESS" ~/.pm2/logs/llm-defender-subnet-miner0-out.log
2023-12-09 12:27:38.034 |     SUCCESS      | Processed synapse from UID: 19 - Confidence: 0.3333333730697632
2023-12-09 12:27:43.231 |     SUCCESS      | Processed synapse from UID: 83 - Confidence: 0.3333333730697632
2023-12-09 12:27:43.671 |     SUCCESS      | Processed synapse from UID: 21 - Confidence: 0.3333333730697632
2023-12-09 12:27:46.779 |     SUCCESS      | Processed synapse from UID: 87 - Confidence: 0.3333333730697632
```


## Capabilities
The subnet contains the following capabilities and engines
- [Prompt Injection](https://llmtop10.com/llm01/)
    - Text classification
    - Heuristics (multiple methods including YARA)
    - Vector analysis

The current capabilities focus on analyzing the initial input prompt but the short-term target is to expand the capabilities in such a way that analyzing complex multi-stage injections becomes possible.

Further capabilities and engines will be added to the subnet in the future to expand the capabilities to cover functional use cases other than prompt injection. Our mission is to be the enabler for secure AI applications.

## FAQ
This section will be updated regularly with commonly asked questions.
- Why are there multiple engines?
  - A single engine can be prone for false-positives and in order to reach a definite conclusion about the legitimacy of an input we need to take into account input from multiple different engines. 

- I have already deployed \<insert local solution here>, how do I benefit from this solution?
  - As per the defense-in-depth concept, the fundamental idea is to layer up defenses for your LLM application. This solution is not meant to replace your local defenses but rather offload some of the computing-heavy analysis to be performed by the decentralized machine-learning network.

The incentive mechanism that is built-in to Bittensor will ensure the intelligence of the network will grow as time goes on and in the long-run the solution is expected to outperform any local defensive measures you have deployed.


## Fine-tuning and Development
Fine-tuning and development have been described in their respective guides:
- [Developer Guide](./docs/developer-guide.md)
- [Fine-tuning Guide](./docs/fine-tuning-guide.md)

# SN14 patching policy (DRAFT)

In order to ensure the subnet users can prepare in advance we have defined a formal patching policy for the subnet components.

The subnet uses **semantic versioning** in which the version number consists of three parts (Major.Minor.Patch) and an optional pre-release tag (-beta, -alpha). Depending on the type of release, there are a few things that the subnet users should be aware of.

- Major Releases (**X**.0.0)
    - There can be breaking changes and updates are mandatory for all subnet users.
    - After the update is released, the `weights_version` hyperparameter is adjusted immediately after release such that in order to set the weights in the subnet, the neurons must be running the latest version.
    - Major releases are communicated in the SN14 Discord Channel at least 1 week in advance
    - The major release will always be done on Wednesday roughly at 15:00 UTC+0
    - Registration may be disabled for up to 24 hours

- Minor releases (0.**X**.0)
    - There can be breaking changes.
    - In case there are breaking changes, the update will be announced in the SN14 Discord Channel at least 48 hours in advance. Otherwise a minimum of 24 hour notice is given.
    - If there are breaking changes, the `weights_version` hyperparameter is adjusted immediately after release such that in order to set the weights in the subnet, the neurons must be running the latest version.
    - If there are no breaking changes, the `weights_version` hyperparameter will be adjusted 24 hours after the launch.
    - Minor releases are released on weekdays roughly at 15:00 UTC+0.
    - Minor releases are mandatory for all subnet users
    - Registration may be disabled for up to 24 hours

- Patch releases (0.0.**X**)
    - Patch releases do not contain breaking changes and updates will not be mandatory unless there is a need to hotfix either scoring or penalty algorithms
    - Patch releases without changes to scoring or penalty algorithms are pushed to production without a prior notice and the update the update is optional

## How to integrate into the subnet?
One of the long-term development targets we have is to provide a subnet that all Bittensor users can rely on when securing their subnets, applications and other solutions built on top of the Bittensor platform. 

This section will be updated once we are farther into the development cycle, but you can already integrate into the subnet and play around with it.

You need to first register a validator into the subnet and once you have it, you can use the validator to query the miners within the subnet.

As an example, we have prepared a simple script ([api_example.py](./scripts/api_example.py)) you can refer to when interacting with the network.

```
$ python scripts/api_example.py
