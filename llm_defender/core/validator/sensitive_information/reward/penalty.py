    This function checks the total penalty score within the false positive category.

    A penalty of 20.0 is added if any of the inputs (uid or miner_responses)
    is not inputted.

    Arguments:
        uid:
            An int instance displaying a unique user id for a miner. Must be
            between 0 and 255.
        miner_responses:
            A iterable instance where each element must be a dict instance
            containing flag 'engine_data'. Each value associated with the
            'engine_data' key must itself be a dict instance containing the
            flags 'name' and 'data'. The 'name' flag should have a value that
            is a str instance displaying the name of the specific engine, and
            the 'data' flag should have a value that contains the engine
            outputs.

        penalty:
            The final penalty value for the _check_response_history() method.
            A penalty of 20.0 is also added if any of the inputs (uid or miner_responses)

            'name' which is the name of a specific engine.
